Canopy height models are derived from airborne (2009) and drone (2019) lidar, and were calculated at 5 m (CHM09_AOI_res500.tif, CHM19_AOI_res500.tif) or 1.25 m (CHM09_AOI_res125.tif, CHM19_AOI_res125.tif) resolution. The 5 m resolution data were used for biomass and canopy height change analyses; the 1.25 m data were used for gap size frequency analysis.

Plot data (in "PlotData" folder) were previously collected by otheres and are publicly available through the CARBONO project at La Selva (https://tropicalstudies.org/carbono-project/).
